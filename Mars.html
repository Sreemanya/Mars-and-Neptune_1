                        Mars is dry, rocky, and bitter cold. The fourth planet from the Sun, Mars is
one of Earth's two closest planetary neighbors (Venus is the other). Mars is
one of the easiest planets to spot in the night sky – it looks like a bright red
point of light.

Its has a thin atmosphere. One day on Mars takes a little over 24 hours. Mars makes a complete orbit around the Sun (a year in Martian time) in 687 Earth days.

                When the solar system settled into its current layout about 4.5
                billion years ago, Mars formed when gravity pulled swirling gas and dust in
                to become the fourth planet from the Sun. Mars is about half the size of
                Earth, and like its fellow terrestrial planets, it has a central core, a rocky
                mantle, and a solid crust.

                    Mars has a dense core at its center between 930 and 1,300 miles
                    (1,500 to 2,100 kilometers) in radius. It&#39;s made of iron, nickel, and sulfur.
                    Surrounding the core is a rocky mantle between 770 and 1,170 miles (1,240
                    to 1,880 kilometers) thick, and above that, a crust made of iron, magnesium,
                    aluminum, calcium, and potassium. This crust is between 6 and 30 miles (10
                    to 50 kilometers) deep.

                    The Red Planet is actually many colors. At the surface, we see
colors such as brown, gold, and tan. The reason Mars looks reddish is due to
oxidization – or rusting – of iron in the rocks, regolith (Martian “soil”), and
dust of Mars. This dust gets kicked up into the atmosphere and from a
distance makes the planet appear mostly red.
 Interestingly, while Mars is about half the diameter of Earth, its surface has
nearly the same area as Earth’s dry land. Its volcanoes, impact craters,
crustal movement, and atmospheric conditions such as dust storms have
altered the landscape of Mars over many years, creating some of the solar
system&#39;s most interesting topographical features.

                    Mars has a thin atmosphere made up mostly of carbon
dioxide, nitrogen, and argon gases. To our eyes, the sky would be hazy and
red because of suspended dust instead of the familiar blue tint we see on
Earth. Mars' sparse atmosphere doesn't offer much protection from impacts
by such objects as meteorites, asteroids, and comets. The temperature on Mars can be as high as 70 degrees Fahrenheit (20
degrees Celsius) or as low as about -225 degrees Fahrenheit (-153 degrees
Celsius). And because the atmosphere is so thin, heat from the Sun easily
escapes this planet. If you were to stand on the surface of Mars on the
equator at noon, it would feel like spring at your feet (75 degrees Fahrenheit
or 24 degrees Celsius) and winter at your head (32 degrees Fahrenheit or 0
degrees Celsius).Occasionally, winds on Mars are strong enough to create dust storms that
cover much of the planet. After such storms, it can be months before all of the
dust settles.
