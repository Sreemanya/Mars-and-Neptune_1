                        Earth is the third planet from the Sun and the only astronomical object known to harbour and support life. Its hydrosphere is the only one in the Solar system sustaining large bodies of liquid surface water. Furthermore Earth's surface is predominantly water, either as water ice at the polar regions, but mostly as liquid water making 70.8% of Earth's surface, mainly consisting of the Ocean, with its oceans, seas, gulfs, etc., but also other salt-water and freshwater bodies like lakes and rivers. The remaining 29.2% of Earth's surface is land consisting of continents and islands, most of it lying in the land hemisphere. The surface alltogether rests on several rigid tectonic plates[list] of Earth's crust, which migrate over many millions of years and are driven by a convective mantle around a solid iron inner core and a liquid outer core, which generates Earth's magnetic field, deflecting destructive solar winds and generating polar lights.

                    When the solar system settled into its current layout about 4.5 billion years ago, Earth formed when gravity pulled swirling gas and dust in to become the third planet from the Sun. Like its fellow terrestrial planets, Earth has a central core, a rocky mantle, and a solid crust.

                    The structure of the earth is divided into four major components: the crust, the mantle, the outer core, and the inner core. Each layer has a unique chemical composition, physical state, and can impact life on Earth's surface.Movement in the mantle caused by variations in heat from the core, cause the plates to shift, which can cause earthquakes and volcanic eruptions. These natural hazards then change our landscape, and in some cases, threaten lives and property. Learn more about how the earth is constructed with these classroom resources.

                    Most of the Earth surface, about 70%, is covered with water. The remaining 30% is made up of the seven continental landmasses. Underneath the water that fills the oceans, and the dirt and plants that cover the continents, the Earth's surface layer is made of rock. Mountain ranges, subduction trenches, tectonic plates, and mid-ocean ridges are all visible in the image. The Earth's surface is composed of rigid plates that move relative to each other. The plates have three main motions, and each one has different results.

                    Earth's atmosphere is composed of about 78 percent nitrogen, 21 percent oxygen, 0.9 percent argon, and 0.1 percent other gases. Trace amounts of carbon dioxide, methane, water vapor, and neon are some of the other gases that make up the remaining 0.1 percent. The atmosphere of Earth protects life on Earth by creating pressure allowing for liquid water to exist on the Earth's surface, absorbing ultraviolet solar radiation, warming the surface through heat retention (greenhouse effect), and reducing temperature extremes between day and night (the diurnal temperature variation).

                    By mole fraction (i.e., by number of molecules), dry air contains 78.08% nitrogen, 20.95% oxygen, 0.93% argon, 0.04% carbon dioxide, and small amounts of other gases.[8] Air also contains a variable amount of water vapor, on average around 1% at sea level, and 0.4% over the entire atmosphere. Air composition, temperature, and atmospheric pressure vary with altitude. Within the atmosphere, air suitable for use in photosynthesis by terrestrial plants and breathing of terrestrial animals is found only in Earth's troposphere.
